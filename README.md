# AP_miniproject

This AP mini project is made by Louise DÃ¸rr Nielsen and Thomas Kim Kroman Kjeldsen.

In order to run the program the following libraries needs to be installed for python.

TKinter (https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html)
Winsound  (Windows platform, cannot play the audio inside the program without it but still saves the audio file as Basic.wav when clicking a button in the GUI, used on line 57 in main.py)
Matplotlib  (python -m pip install -U matplotlib, This library can be comments out along with line 54-59 in main.py)
Numpy (pip install numpy)
Soundfile (pip install soundfile)

The program is written in Python using Pycharm, and made as part of the Audio processing class for Medialogy at Aalborg University 2020.

The github page (https://github.com/LouiseDoorr/AP_miniproject) contains:

main.py (Program file containing the code)
AP_miniproject_report.pdf (PDF report written about the Karplus Strong method and the program)
